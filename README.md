# WCG24 Cross Sections

This is the repository for the cross section files from arxiv:2408.XXXXX. The columns of each `.table` file correspond to the columns of the tables in Appendix C.
* `CT18ANNLO` primary NNLO cross sections from the paper
* `CT18ANLO` NLO version of the calculations
* `EPPS21nlo_CT18Anlo_O16` NLO oxygen cross sections (sigma/A)
* `EPPS21nlo_CT18Anlo_Fe56` NLO iron cross sections (sigma/A)
* `EPPS21nlo_CT18Anlo_Pb208` NLO oxygen cross sections (sigma/A)
* `NNPDF40_nnlo_as_01180_mhou` NNLO cross sections using NNPDF4

I plan to include spline tables (using [photospline](https://github.com/icecube/photospline)) of the single- and double-differential cross sections and the PDF uncertainties soon.

I will also be releasing NC (without CKMT-PCAC) and nutau cross sections compatible with these cross sections in the near future. Stay tuned!

If you have any questions or find any issues, please contact me (pweigel@mit.edu)!
